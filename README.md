# Password-Generator
Project was to make a very basic web app that would generate random passwords. I tried to go above and beyond by making the website more interactive. Which made the project more complicated. I got it to a working condition. Although, I am not super happy about how much my code becomes repetitive.  Hopefully I will come back to this when I know more about cleaning up the code and making the website more efficient.
